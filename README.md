# BankID and Nexi Payments Integration API
BankID API and Nexi Payments in Java

(Some advices: Not optimized for Production environment

Test were made thought Springboot OpenAPI and Postman.

Java truststore in use was downloaded from Bank Demo git page https://github.com/BankID/SampleCode/tree/main/server/certificates/test

The Nexi certificates were downloaded direct from the test website https://test.api.dibspayment.eu/
)

This project integrates BankID for user authentication and Nexi Payments for payment processing in a Java Spring Boot API. The API enables secure identity verification through BankID and facilitates transactions using Nexi's payment gateway.

It demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot, Swagger (OpenAPI), BankID, and Nexi Payments in a Java-based API. The project also includes WebFlux and other libraries for building a reactive web application.

Project Description

The SpringSwaggerIntegration project is a demonstration of a Spring Boot application with integrated Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation, along with support for BankID and Nexi payments. It showcases how to build a reactive web application using Spring WebFlux and how to secure the app with Spring Security. Additionally, the project includes QR code generation using the ZXing library.
Key Features:

    Spring Boot application with WebFlux and reactive programming.
    Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
    BankID authentication integration.
    Nexi Payments processing.
    QR code generation using ZXing.
    Security with Spring Security.

Technologies Used

    Java 22
    Spring Boot 3.3.2
        Spring Boot Starter Data JDBC
        Spring Boot Starter Web
        Spring Boot Starter Security
    Swagger/OpenAPI (springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui)
    H2 Database (for development and testing)
    WebFlux (for reactive programming)
    Netty (used with WebFlux)
    ZXing (for QR code generation)
    Apache HttpClient5 (for making HTTP requests)
    BankID integration libraries
    Nexi Payments API integration

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

    Java 22 or higher
    Maven (for dependency management)
    Git (for cloning the repository)

Additionally, you will need:

    BankID Test Credentials (for BankID integration)
    Nexi Payments API Keys (for Nexi payment processing)

Installation

To get started with the project:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpringSwaggerIntegration.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd SpringSwaggerIntegration

Install dependencies:

bash

mvn clean install

Set up environment variables or configuration: Update the application.properties file with your BankID and Nexi credentials:

properties

# BankID Configuration
bankid.api.base-url=https://test.bankid.com
bankid.api.key-store-path=path/to/keystore.p12
bankid.api.key-store-password=yourpassword

# Nexi Payment API Configurations
dibs.api.base-url=https://test.api.dibspayment.eu
dibs.api.checkout-key=your-checkout-key
dibs.api.secret-key=your-secret-key

Run the application:

bash

    mvn spring-boot:run

Usage

The application exposes various APIs for testing BankID authentication, Nexi Payments, and QR code generation. After starting the application, you can access the API documentation via Swagger UI.
Running Locally

The application will be available at:

arduino

http://localhost:3000
